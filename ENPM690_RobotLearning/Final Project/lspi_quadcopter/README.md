# Autonomous Control and Landing of a Quadcopter using Reinforcement Learning - Least Square Policy Iteration (LSPI)

## LSPI is a policy iteration method to approximate the state-action value function for continuous state and action space. The approximated Q(s,a) function can be further used to get an optimal/sub-optimal policy to 

#### Information to run the code 
- In the terminal where you can run python scripts go to the directory where these files are,
- Make sure that numpy is installed.

- To run the code for training the models:

  **$ python train_model.py**

- To run the code for for the simulating the quadcopter and checking its landing:
  **$ python lander.py**
