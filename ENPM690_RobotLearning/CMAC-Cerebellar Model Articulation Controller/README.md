#### Information to run the code
Go to the directory where these files are:

To run the code for training the models (discrete and continuous cmac):

$ python cmac_nn.py




To run the code for the convergence test:

$ python cmac_convergence.py


Make sure the terminal can run python scripts and has numpy installed

Results:

Discrete CMAC - generalization factor = 10
