# CMAC - Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller

## This is to program and train a 1-D discrete and continuous CMAC network. 

#### Information to run the code
Go to the directory where these files are:

To run the code for training the models (discrete and continuous cmac):

**$ python cmac_nn.py**




To run the code for checking the effect of generalization factor or overlapping on the convergence and the accuracy of the model:

**$ python cmac_convergence.py**


Make sure the terminal can run python scripts and has numpy installed
