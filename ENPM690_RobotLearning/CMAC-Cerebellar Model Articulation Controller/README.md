# CMAC - Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller

## This is to program and train a 1-D discrete and continuous CMAC network. 

#### Information to run the code 
- In the terminal where you can run python scripts go to the directory where these files are,
- Make sure that numpy is installed.

-- To run the code for training the models (discrete and continuous cmac):

**$ python cmac_nn.py**

-- To run the code for checking the effect of generalization factor or overlapping on the convergence and the accuracy of the model:

**$ python cmac_convergence.py**
